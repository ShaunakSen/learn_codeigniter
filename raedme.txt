we create a custom function say test:
public function test()
    {
        echo "This is the test method for the view controllers";
    }

how to access this: go to url: http://localhost/series/ci/index.php/welcome/test
it should be of format: path/index.php/class_name/method_name


Create a new controller as Home.php
<?php
class Home extends CI_Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $this->load->view('home_view');
    }
}
?>

now create this view in views/home_view.php
<h4>Hello.. This is Home View</h4>

go to url: http://localhost/series/ci/index.php/home
to see this view
